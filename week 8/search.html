                        I can add on my search input a autocomplete
                         equals off if I don't want to see my own history for whatever reason.
                        I don't want people knowing I'm searching for cats and dogs
                        on this page.
                        I can auto focus on the text box so that it
                        shows the cursor blinking in that box by default.-->
