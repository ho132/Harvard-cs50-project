f you've ever shared a URL on Facebook or Twitter
or Slack or Discord or any number of websites nowadays
that automatically show a nice preview where you suddenly
see the default image of the page, maybe a few sentences or words
of text or something like that.
Sometimes those applications, those websites,
will just choose the first image it finds
on the website or the first sentence it sees and show that.
But that might not be very user friendly or search engine friendly.
And so a developer might want to control what
it is that Slack, Discord, Facebook, Twitter, and other such sites
show by default.
For that you can use nowadays what are called open graph tags, which is to say
there's other uses of the meta tag.
