<!--he browser.
In this case, viewport is the technical term for the big rectangular region
to which I keep referring.
The body, really, of your page.
The content for the viewport, you can say some esoteric details like this.
The initial scale should be one.
That is no matter who visits your site, it shouldn't start zoomed in.
It shouldn't start zoomed out.
It should start at just the default sizing.
And then this here, width equals device width,
is a very arcane way of saying if the user has a small screen,
show the text proportional to that size.
Don't just try to cram it all into a tiny little window.
So it's super simple.
But if for the next problem set or future projects
as well you find that just things look really bad on mobile, this kind of tag
is the place to start, met-->
